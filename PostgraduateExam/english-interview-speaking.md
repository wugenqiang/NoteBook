Second, I often feel upset when I am busy. However, after four years' studying in college, I improved myself a lot. Though I am still shy and upset sometimes, I am much better than how I was four years ago. I hope I can perform well in this interview, go on to another stage in my life and overcome my weaknesses eventually.

### 例题讲解

#### 远程教育

* What do you think of the distance-learning programs?
  * （第一段）I think distance-learning program is a new and effective educational pattern.（定义法）
  * （第二段）First, it increases one's opportunity of being educated, especially those with limited mobility, such as the elderly, the disabled and the injured, and also those with an irregular work schedule. For example,（举例法）some individuals who do really have jobs or take care of babies find that they can do their own things and study at the same time. Second, through distance-learning, students can communicate and interact with other students all over the country or even the world. As a result, information and knowledge can be shared. Third, distance-learning allows you to learn at your own pace. In a classroom, when everyone is taught together, it is often difficult to keep all students on the same page. This is where distance learning has an advantage over regular courses. Since you are given all course work beforehand, you can study as much or as little as you want every day, as long as you complete your study materials in time.
